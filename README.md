### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Marilena, Iâ€™m 31 years old and I live in Rome. Currently Iâ€™m working as Data Engineer/Data Analyst in Telecom Italia. My pronouns are she/her. 

:computer: I have a M. Sc. in Engineering in Computer Science with main focus on Data Management and Data Integration. I use both relational and non-relational databases (MongoDB). I usually code in Java, Javascript and Python. 


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Developement, so you'll find a lot of repositories used for practicing my skills up there.
